FilterSynthesis
===============

A python script to calculate all values for a filter.

Currently supports only a Low pass Butterworth, Sallen & Key filter of any oder.

Long term plan - to support other filter types (Chebyshev etc.) for Band Pass/Stop, High / Low pass. 
Would be good to get the script to output a netlist / QUCS schematic. 

Script is currently functional, but the UI needs doing.
